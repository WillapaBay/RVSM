Tasks:
1. Generate computation polygons and number them correctly (see Zhong's email for instructions)
2. Generate input files (details forthcoming)
3. Generate output map (this email--see below)
4. Generate output timeseries (self-explanatory using veg_sum_out.opt)
5. Generate output map in terms of habitat suitability (details forthcoming)

Task 3: Generate output map

We want to automate the following process:
veg_out.opt --> veg_out_forGIS.txt --> Veg_Polygon_Out.txt
veg_out.opt = Output file generated by RVSM veg_out_forGIS.txt = Intermediate file to be automatically generated by Elliot's script (currently generated in excel with a conditional equation) Veg_Polygon.zip = Computational mesh shape file Veg_Polygon_Out.txt = Final file to be automatically generated in ArcMap (later RAS-Mapper) by Elliot's script

Steps that need to be automated in ArcMap:
1. Right click Veg_Polygon (computational polygon) layer and "Export data" as shapefile --> Rename "Veg_Polygon_Out" and select add to map
2. Open attribute table of Veg_Polygon_Out and select "Add fields" from drop down menu of left most icon
3. Add 3 fields for every time step that you want to visualize (at least initial and final): Day; Veg_Type; VegHt_ft
4. Right click Veg_Polygon_Out and select "Edit features" and "Start editing"
5. Paste data from veg_out_forGIS (second tab) into Veg_Polygon_Out attribute table
